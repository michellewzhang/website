				<h3 class="proj-heading">overview</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">
					Schema Builder is an application that allows users to build dialog schema,
					which are then passed into models trained on a dataset for transfer learning.
					From September to December 2020, I designed and developed Schema Builder under the guidance of
					Shikib Mehri and Dr. Maxine Eskenazi (DialRC, Language Technologies Institute, CMU).
					<br><br>
					The completed application allows users to drag and drop components and arrows to
					create a flowchart-style graph representing their schema diagram, and subsequently offers users
					the ability to test their dialog implementation by interacting with the system through a chatbox.
					<br><br>
					The main goals of the project were designing a feasible prototype,
					developing functional user interfaces, creating a useful
					data representation, developing the API, and finally integrating the frontend
					and backend together with a model. Under the guidance of my mentor,
					I successfully completed all project milestones in three months.

				<h3 class="proj-heading">motivation: STAR dataset</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">STAR is a schema-guided,
					task-oriented dialog dataset that facilitates transfer learning.
					With the development of novel schema-guided dialog models that use an explicit description of
					known tasks to generalize to unknown tasks, Schema Builder allows users to build arbitrary schemas,
					pass them to learning models, and potentially create a dialog model for a new domain.<br><br>
					Preliminary testing of the schema-guided models for model generalizability and task
					transfer shows potential for performance improvement on unseen tasks, which provides a baseline
					for future research in the field. I built a user interface that can, in the future, work in
					conjunction with zero-shot learning models.

				<p class="proj-text">I used Figma to prototype the main features and proposed navigation of the

					a snapshot of the dialog builder in action. In this design, I focused on incorporating elements of
					material design to form a clean and intuitive UI.

				<h3 class="proj-heading">frontend</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">The UI could be broken down into two components: the drag and drop dialog builder
					area,
					and the messaging area.
					For the drag-drop area, I built upon the React Flow library, which contains useful
					functions that aided during the data representation phase of the project.
					Retrospectively, during this phase, one of the main challenges was navigating the React framework,
					since it was a relatively new skill, but having the hands-on learning experience was helpful.

			<div class="card-op">
				<h3 class="proj-heading">data representation</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">After the majority of frontend development was complete,
					I needed to design a data representation that would be useful for passing to the backend.
					Given a sample data object from my mentor, I logged my output in the console to ensure that
					it matched the target output. Data I needed to keep track of included message exchange history,
					nodes and edges in the graph, exact connections between nodes, and unique user IDs.

				<h3 class="proj-heading">backend</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">Before beginning any API development, I
					needed to read documentation on the framework my mentor suggested using: Python Tornado.
					When I began the project, one of my personal goals was to improve my understanding of
					backend development and gain hands-on experience developing my own API.
					The API I developed for Schema Builder stores the user and system message
					exchange history as well as the saved schema. Each user is defined by a unique ID generated
					on the frontend, which helps the backend track what data belongs to each user.

					The final product is a complex, multifunctional, and intuitively-designed
					application that both serves the goal of the project and follows the
					prototype design I had initially imagined. <br><br>

					Working on the Schema Builder was truly rewarding,
					because I gained experience in not only full stack development,
					but also design thinking. By the nature of React and the complexity of
					what I needed to create, there were several times where I had to
					find clever ways to pass data, restructure components, and
					use states to accomplish my task. Working with my mentor on issues
					I could not resolve helped me understand different ways of
					thinking about problems; as a result, deep design thinking
					went into each component I created and developed for Schema Builder. <br><br>
				</p>

				<p class="proj-text">
					<br><br><br>
					The entire project allowed me to exercise many of my existing skills and
					learn many new ones. I put my design skills into practice by creating
					the prototype; I gained familiarity with React, which is a useful
					tool that I can add to my frontend skillset; I learned about backend
					development and built my first API; I improved my understanding of how frontend
					and backend integrate and coexist; I also gained a basic understanding on the
					state of current research in dialog systems. Overall, I learned to view web
					development from varying perspectives at different times in the development process.
					These skills will invariably prove useful as I progress forward in my career, and I
					am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the DialRC Group.
