				<h3 class="proj-heading">overview</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">In Spring 2021, I took a
					course called CS Pedagogy, through which I worked with one other classmate to develop educational
					exercises for a high school CS/Python Curriculum (CMU CS Academy). I created content for the
					Music Module, which aims to teach students the fundamentals of music theory and algorithmic music
					generation.<br><br>

					The exercises I created involve computer-generated art and music, including music generation
					based on Markov transition probabilities and Euclidean rhythm patterns. Most of my exercises were
					interactive (through keyboard and mouse, as in the demos above). They covered a wide range of
					musical topics, such as harmony, motifs, and rhythm. Since the course teaches Python, all of
					the exercises were developed entirely in CS Academy's version of Python. <br><br>

					In addition to ideating, designing, developing, and refining around ten of these creative music
					exercises throughout the duration of this course, I learned about the art of pedagogy and how to
					effectively create educational content, as well as how to be more effective at giving and receiving feedback
					during a critique.<br><br>

					The content of the course fascinated me because I've always loved exploring the intersection of art and computing.
					I was especially excited to work on the Music Module (other modules include Art and Game Design) because I have
					a background in classical music. This class was my first experience with educational content creation, and
					though working with creative code was definitely challenging, it was so rewarding!
