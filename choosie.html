                <p class="proj-text">
                    Choosie is the result of a group project I worked on while taking 05-470: Digital Service Innovation
                    in Spring 2021. Throughout the 8 weeks that we worked together, we conceived and refined a digital
                    service startup, conducted customer discovery and other market research, and eventually pitched our
                    startup to investors at the end of the semester, where we placed second!
                    <br><br>

                <p class="proj-text">
                    Before the project, each student in the class briefly pitched a startup idea, and my idea, Choosie,
                    was chosen as one of nine top ideas. My primary role in the group was product manager: I helped my
                    team stay accountable and focused, and also organized and led weekly meetings. In these meetings, I
                    ensured that each team member understood the deliverable requirements and delegated tasks according
                    to the members’ strengths. In addition, I helped direct the team in revising our vision based on
                    feedback we received from peers, professors, and other guests after numerous critiques.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">problem space</h3>
                <p class="proj-text">Within a group, deciding on a restaurant is challenging because people may have a
                    variety of different allergies, dietary restrictions, and other cuisine preferences. In addition,
                    each group member may have differing budget and distance-related needs. And lastly, some people may
                    not feel comfortable voicing their opinions aloud, which occurs sometimes in workplaces as a result
                    of social dynamics.
                    <br><br> Our digital service startup, Choosie, aims to address this problem space by providing
                    efficient restaurant recommendations for groups, while simultaneously benefiting restaurants by
                    providing them with potential food-allergic customers who would otherwise not dine there due to
                    safety concerns.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">market research</h3>
                <p class="proj-text">
                    To validate our understanding of the problem space, our team conducted extensive market research to
                    understand the environmental factors that would provide opportunities for Choosie to create value
                    for consumers.
                    <br><br>
                    We used lean business tools like PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and
                    environmental) analysis, as well as SET & Product Opportunity Gap (POG) analysis. We also defined
                    stakeholders and created a value flow chart to help us better understand the parties involved and
                    how value could be exchanged and co-created between parties.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">customer discovery </h3>
                <p class="proj-text">In addition to conducting market research and analyzing third-party data, our team
                    conducted a series of customer interviews with potential target users. We conducted structured
                    individual interviews, in which we used a directed storytelling technique in order to hear stories
                    from users that would help us learn about how groups make decisions.
                    <br><br>We also conducted group interviews and contextual observation to further observe group
                    decision-making behavior. From these interviews, we narrowed down the target users and key
                    stakeholders involved, which we subsequently embodied in three personas: a person with food
                    allergies, a restaurant owner, and a frequent traveler with dietary restrictions.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">pivot </h3>
                <p class="proj-text">The initial idea for Choosie -- the idea I pitched to the class -- was a movie
                    recommendation system, but when our team conducted customer research, we learned that this
                    proposition wouldn’t provide much value to users because people don’t watch movies frequently
                    enough.
                    <br><br>We instead learned that people are facing the difficult decision of deciding where to eat
                    much more often; this problem seemed to even be heightened by the pandemic due to people’s busy
                    lifestyles and unpredictable budgets. Thus, the insights from our customer discovery led us to pivot
                    to a new problem space.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">mvp </h3>
                <p class="proj-text"> In the class, we defined a minimum viable product (MVP) as something that’s just
                    enough to validate the user’s needs, so we decided to start small by initially providing the food
                    recommendation service to users in the Pittsburgh area. To validate our MVP, we devised a short
                    four-step process that would simulate the most basic features of Choosie:

                            preferences, like allergies, special diets, and budget limits.

                    <li>
                        <p class="proj-text"><b>ANALYSIS:</b> Choosie compiles and analyzes the group’s data and selects
                            a few restaurants that work for everyone.

                            back to the users, along with specific allergen info for each restaurant.

                <h3 class="proj-heading">feedback from investors</h3>
                <p class="proj-text">During our discussions with 9 potential investors, we learned that a large
                    proportion of them actually have dietary restrictions, allergies, or otherwise strongly resonated
                    with the problem space we were targeting. It was exciting to see the value that Choosie could hold
                    in consumers’ lives and to be able to validate our stakeholder value, even at our final pitch.
                    <br><br>
                    A majority of our feedback surrounded the restaurant side of the partnership -- our investors asked
                    us to really narrow down how we would get restaurant menus and parse it efficiently; how we would
                    build trust with food-allergic users and how we’d deal with liability if the allergens were tagged
                    incorrectly. In addition, we were asked to consider restaurants that would be willing to accommodate
                    for certain dietary restrictions, like swapping out normal flour for a gluten-free option.
                    <br><br>
                    One investor challenged our original idea of gaining revenue by allowing restaurants to pay to be
                    higher up on the recommendation list, which he explained might break trust with the users. Our team
                    agreed that this was a great point -- we hadn’t thought about how we would interweave the sponsored
                    or promoted restaurants with the top recommendations, or how we would ensure that the promoted
                    restaurants were also entirely appropriate for the group. Overall, the investors brought up many
                    points that our team had not had the chance to fully consider, and we really appreciated hearing
                    their feedback.

                </h3>
                <p class="proj-text">I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to work with such a diverse group of
                    people. My team members had many unique ways of thinking about problems whenever I asked them for
                    advice, which helped me see these problems from a more creative perspective. Working and leading
                    this interdisciplinary team has helped me develop important communicative and collaborative skills
                    that will doubtlessly aid with future projects and work.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, this class was my first experience with entrepreneurship, and although I do not plan to
                    pursue this track in the future, I believe that learning about lean business practices,
                    product-market fit, and digital service conception has definitely still benefited me and challenged
                    me to think in new ways.
