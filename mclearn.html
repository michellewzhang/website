				<h3 class="proj-heading">overview</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">From May to July 2020, I had the opportunity to work with
					the McLearn Lab (Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University)
					to design and develop a responsive lab website featuring
					the lab's projects, members, publications, and news. To manage the large amount of data
					on the site, I also created a content management system (CMS), which can be easily
					navigated by those with no familiarity with web development.<br><br>

					The frontend of both projects were implemented entirely using Angular,
					with particular emphasis on implementing Angular Material.
					<br><br>

					As the only intern working on the website, most of the development and design
					was my responsibility. My mentor aided with backend-related aspects including building and deploying
					APIs storing lab data and implementing HTTP interceptors for authorization. I developed the
					frontend, integrated the APIs, and created the CMS.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="proj-heading">design conception</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">An abundance of independent research went into
					the finalized design of the website. I had
					key features in mind:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						responsiveness
					</li><br>
					<li>
						simple, modern, and professional interface
					</li><br>
					<li>
						consistent design throughout website
					</li><br>
					<li>
						minimize scrolling
					</li><br>
					<li>
						fixed navigation or tabs
					</li><br>
				</ul>
				<p class="proj-text">Along with exploring various university lab websites to
					understand the standard content and verbiage, as well as to note
					what features I liked and disliked, I created a mock website to test
					potential design concepts.
					I met with the lab members and other interns to ask for feedback
					before finalizing the design.

				<h3 class="proj-heading">implementing responsiveness</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">As technology continues to evolve, we will continue to
					see the increasing necessity of designing flexible and adaptable products.
					Responsive web design ensures that an application will both look
					appealing and still be functional on various screen sizes.</p>

				<p class="proj-text">Responsive tools involved in this project include</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						CSS media queries
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Angular Material + flex layout
					</li><br>
					<li>
						Google DevTools device mode
					</li><br>
				</ul>
				<p class="proj-text">I designed with standard sizes of mobile phones,
					tablets, laptops, and desktops in mind. The experience taught me
					that developing for
					responsiveness involves hours and hours of testing,
					experimenting, and sometimes, completely redesigning.
				</p>

				<h3 class="proj-heading">content management: connecting frontend & backend</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">Having a CMS allows those without web dev knowledge
					to edit the content of websites. It's essentially a link between the frontend and backend:
					data is loaded from the backend to the CMS, and all changes (HTTP requests) made in the CMS
					are subsequently updated in the backend and synchronously reflected on the frontend of the website.
				</p>
				<p class="proj-text">Key features of the CMS include
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						ability to edit, add, and delete content quickly
					</li><br>
					<li>
						organized, intuitive, and easily navigable UI
					</li><br>
					<li>
						authentication / login page to protect content
					</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="card-op">
				<h3 class="proj-heading">data representation</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">With the task of displaying data comes the challenge
					of deciding how to represent it. My mentor and I went through several
					rounds of redesigning the data objects for each page of the website. As
					each page had different data, each would need a distinct representation.
					Each time new issues arised, we realized
					that certain changes to the representation were necessary.
				</p>
				<p class="proj-text">Some changes were as small as adding a new property
					to an object, while others were drastic and required a completely new structure &#8212;
					which meant the frontend would need to be redesigned also.
				</p>

				<p class="proj-text">Trial-and-error, testing,
					and patience played a key role in the entire integration process.
				</p>

			<div class="card-op">
				<h3 class="proj-heading"><img src="images/star.png" class="header-icon-concluding">concluding thoughts
				</h3>
				<p class="proj-text">I found this experience truly rewarding:
					I taught myself the basics of Angular, gained experience in testing
					and integrating RESTful APIs, familiarized myself
					with the state of educational technology research,
					read and discussed several research papers with lab members and fellow interns,
					and developed a functional and responsive website and CMS, all within three months.<br><br>

					Throughout those three months, I met a number of challenges and worked my way around them &#8212;
					albeit sometimes by taking unconventional routes. Finally, I've vastly improved my knowledge on
					responsive design,
					which I will undoubtedly take with me into the future.
